# Model to Predict Household Occupancy using Motion Sensor Data
 
The aim of this model is to create a simple model to predict whether a household is singular or multiple occupancy using data from motion sensors. 


## Approach 

A number of assumptions were made prior to the task
- average walking speed between rooms
- size of rooms are equal
- all homes have the same layout
- there are no pets in the homes
- there are no visitors to the homes
- sensors have the same placement in all homes
- all sensors are the same model and operate with same performance

All work is carried out in the prediction_model.ipynb.

## Running the project
Libraries used
- python version 3
- SQLite 3
- pandas
