# Model to Predict Household Occupancy using Motion Sensor Data
 
The aim of this model is to create a simple model to predict whether a household is singular or multiple occupancy using data from motion sensors. 


## Approach 

A number of assumptions were made
- average walking speed between rooms
- size of rooms are equal
- all homes have the same layout
- there are no pets in the homes
- there are no visitors to the homes
- sensors have the same placement in all homes
- all sensors are the same and operate with same performance

## How to install and run the project

- python version 3
- SQLite 3
- pandas
